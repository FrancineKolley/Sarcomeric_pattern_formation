This folder contains two scripts.
#1 First, use the script Detect_nematic_order.m to load your file. With this matlab script pre-processing is apllied to the image using Gauss-filter and Trop-hat transformation. Regions of interests are defined using a treshhold and the steerable filter is used to detect the local nematic director of each single ROI.

#2 Second, the Script Correlation_function.m can be used to do linescans along the nematic direction, to compute correlation functions.
