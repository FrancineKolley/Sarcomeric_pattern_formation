# Sarcomeric_pattern_formation
This GitHub Repository includes examples for the image-analysis algorithm and simulation code, used in my PhD thesis "Physical principles of pattern formation during myofibrillogenesis" and the manuscript (preprint) https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.01.551279v1. 

This repository contains the followuing supporting code:

(1) A tracking-free algorithm to compute correlation functions from multi-channel images, using a steerable filter to compute the local nematic director.
    The algorithm was modified in collaboration with Benoit Dehapiot. An older version of the code can be found on https://github.com/BDehapiot/BDProject_FDomMuscle_2D .
    Note, that the steerable filter is a programm, accessable over the following URL http://www.francoisaguet.net/software.html .
    Using the steerable filter requires a download of the full folder, including the license! 
    
(2) Example code for our minimal model I - Sarcomeric pattern formation driven by non-local interactions. 
    Code examples are given for both mean-field simulations and agent-based simulations.
